"""HoloIndex per-collection embedding backend routing (TQ3 slice).

TQ2 (docs/audits/holoindex_turboquant/TQ2_FP32_INT8_REAL_CORPUS_AUDIT.md)
measured that the HIA3 TurboQuant ONNX int8 backend is retrieval-equivalent
to fp32 on every production navigation collection *except*
``navigation_vocabulary`` (30-doc corpus; top-5 set-agreement 43.3% vs the
95% gate). Rather than holding int8 off entirely or promoting it globally,
TQ3 adds per-collection routing: int8 where TQ2 proved equivalence, fp32
where it did not.

Contract (WSP 97 truth distinction):

  * Routing is **opt-in**: inactive unless ``HOLO_USE_TURBOQUANT=1``.
  * Routing is **safe**: inactive unless *both* backends loaded cleanly.
  * The fp32 ``SentenceTransformer`` path is always treated as the
    authoritative baseline (it built every row currently in ChromaDB).
  * Collections not listed in the routing map fall back to the fp32
    baseline. Adding a collection to the int8 lane is a deliberate
    policy choice that MUST be backed by a gate re-run (see TQ3 report).
